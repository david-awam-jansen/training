## What is ggplot

## Essentials parts of a ggplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
	geom_point()
```

Let's go through this step by step

-   ggplot() is the function to start the plot

    -   It needs data

    -   It needs aesthetics (aes)

        -   what part of the data do you want to show and how

            -   x and y

            -   color

            -   shape

            -   ...
