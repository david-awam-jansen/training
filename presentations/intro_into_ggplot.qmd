## What is ggplot2?

- **Definition:** ggplot2 is an R package for creating data visualizations based on the grammar of graphics.
- **Created by:** Hadley Wickham
- **First released:** 2007


## Why Use ggplot2?
- **Advantages:**
  - Produces visually appealing and customizable plots.
  - Based on a coherent grammar of graphics, making it easy to understand and use.
  - Works well with tidy data principles.
  - Offers extensive documentation and a large community of users.
  - There are many package that build on ggplot to work with specific kinds of data, e.g.; 
    - **survminer** for survival analysis
    - **ggcorrplot** for correlation plots
    - **gganimate** make plot animations
## Key Features of ggplot2
- **Grammar of Graphics:** A systematic way to describe the components of a graph, including data, aesthetics, and geometric objects.
- **Layered Grammar:** Allows you to build complex plots by adding layers of data and visual elements.
- **Faceting:** Easily create multiple plots based on subsets of your data.
- **Themes:** Customize the appearance of your plots with built-in or custom themes.

## Basic Syntax Overview
- `ggplot()` function: Initializes a ggplot object.
- `aes()` function: Specifies aesthetic mappings between data variables and visual properties.
- `geom_*()` functions: Add geometric objects (points, lines, bars, etc.) to your plot.
- `facet_*()` functions: Facet your plot by one or more variables.
- `theme()` function: Customize the appearance of your plot.

## Example Visualizations
- Show examples of different types of plots created with ggplot2, such as:
  - Scatter plots
  - Line plots
  - Bar plots
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - Density plots
- Briefly discuss how each plot is created and customized using ggplot2 syntax.

## Conclusion
- **Summary:** 
  - ggplot2 is a powerful tool for creating elegant and customizable data visualizations in R.
  - Its grammar of graphics framework makes it intuitive and flexible.
- **Resources:** 
  - Official ggplot2 documentation
  - Online tutorials and community forums
- **Questions:** Open the floor for any questions or discussion.



## What is ggplot

## Essentials parts of a ggplot

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point()
```

Let's go through this step by step

-   ggplot() is the function to start the plot

    -   It needs data

    -   It needs aesthetics (aes)

        -   what part of the data do you want to show and how

            -   x and y

            -   color

            -   shape

            -   ...
