## Terminal

- 'Easy' start with git bash

## Naming

-   Use descriptive names for folders, files and variables

> -   Understandable but not to long
>     -   m1 versus glm_count_full
>     -   data versus tick_counts_EA

::: callout-tip
While a computer will ultimately run your code, it'll be read by humans, so write code intended for humans!

## Naming {.smaller}

> -   Be aware on naming rules of programs
>     -   Avoid special characters (\$, \@, \*)
>     -   Avoid name of functions
>     -   No spaces !!
>     -   Case-sensitive (e.g. R) versus case insensitive (SQL)
>     -   R (and many other languages) names can't start with numbers and does not like spaces
>     -   'car speed in miles per hour' versus 'car speed (mph)' versus car_speed_mph'

## How to deal with R (programming) errors {.smaller}

1.  don't get frustrated by error messages

2.  read the error message

3.  google the error message

4.  google solutions or use ChatGPT

5.  trial and error

    1.  it works --\> go back to your analysis
